# Introduction

## What's VariaNFT?
VariaNFT is a no-code tool for NFT creators. With VariaNFT, you can create a series of NFTs with only SVG and CSV files needed. It's designed for people who need to make a lot of NFTs while slight differences are needed when creating each of them. Some applications are member cards, personal gifts and tickets, with many more to be discovered.

## How does VariaNFT work?
VariaNFT uses the following techniques to deploy your NFT:

### ERC721
NFTs made by VariaNFT complies with [ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) and can be used in most NFT wallets and marketplaces such as [Rarible](https://rarible.com) and [OpenSea](https://opensea.io).

### Rarible Protocol
ERC721 contracts are supported by the Rarible Protocol. You can mint your NFTs under the Rarible Public Collection or deploy your own. If you decide to use your own collection we would also deploy it with [ERC-721 contracts](https://github.com/rariblecom/protocol-contracts/blob/57043e3f9e93223ef9d65dae351d3c55b34e5bf1/tokens/contracts/erc-721/ERC721RaribleUser.sol) developed by the Rarible Protocol.

### NFT.storage
All your data are stored in [NFT.storage](https://nft.storage), set up is not needed as it will be handled for you. If you prefer to store files in your account, there will be an option for you to set your NFT.storage key in the future.

## Getting Started

To start using VariaNFT, you will need to prepare an SVG file and a CSV file.

You can download example files from <a href="https://docs.varianft.studio/file/example.zip" download>here</a>, unzip the file and follow this guide to try it. VariaNFT also works on Rinkeby and Ropsten, only a simple network switch is needed and the rest would be done for you.
