# Create a Project
Once you open the [VariaNFT app](https://app.varianft.studio/), it will create a default project for you. You can either use the project or create a new one.

Click the `Create Project` button to create a new project. The system will ask for the name of your new project.

You can edit the name at any time, this guild will use `VIP Card` for example. After creating, it will switch to `Setting` and you can proceed to [the next step](/docs/getting-started/configure-a-project).

## What's a Project?
In brief, a series of similar NFTs should be created in a project. For example, if a publisher wants to gift zir subscribers a `loyalty card` and a `badge`. Ze can create the two projects. After that, a collection named `Publisher Gift` can be created by ze and what was previously done in the two projects could be used.
