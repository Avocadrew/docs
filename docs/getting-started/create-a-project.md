# Create a Project
Once you open the [VariaNFT app](https://app.varianft.studio/), it will create a default project for you. You can either use the project or create a new one.

To create a new project, click the button `Create Project`, it will ask the name of your new project.

You can edit the name at any time, this guild will use `VIP Card` for example. After creating, it will switch to `Setting` and you can go to [the next step](/docs/getting-started/configure-a-project).

## What's a Project?
Briefly, a series of similar NFTs should be created in a project. For example, if a publisher wants to gift zir subscribers a loyalty card and a badge, ze can create two projects, `loyalty card` and `badge`. Ze can create a collection named `Publisher Gift` and use it in those two projects.
