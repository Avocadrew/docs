# Start Minting

After setting up a project, we can now start minting. Switch to `Mint` and a row of data with the metadata generated from the project setting would be shown.

From the screenshot, we can see that the first row contains 4 columns: id, avatar, username, and address. As we set the value of `name` to `VIP #{id}`, it's therefore rendered as `VIP #1`. In the preview area, we can see that the avatar is replaced with the value of `avatar` in the data table, due to the image element in the SVG file having id `avatar`.

You can switch to the next row by changing values of the field on the right-top or click the button on the sides of the field. The data, metadata, and preview will then update instantly.
