# Start Minting

Aftet set up a project, we can now start minting. Switch to `Mint` and it will show a row of data and the metadata generated from the project setting.
![Switch to Mint](/img/getting-started/switch-mint.png)

From the above screenshot, we can see the first row have 4 columns: id, avatar, username, and address. As we set the value of `name` to `VIP #{id}`, it's therefore rendered as `VIP #1`. In the preview area, we can see the avatar is replaced with the value of `avatar` in the data table, that's because the image element in the SVG file has id `avatar`.

You can switch to next row by changing value of the right-top field or click the button on the sides of the field. The data, metadata, and preview will then update.
