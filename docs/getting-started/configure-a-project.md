Then, select a collection from the `Collection` row. If the identity isn't important for your NFTs (such as fans badges), you can just use Rarible, showed on the top of collections. Otherwise, select _Create New Collection_ and more information about this collection will be asked for.

If you decided to create a new collection, fill the top 4 required fields and the remaining 3 if is needed.

Finally, update name and description in the table and/or add attributes if needed. You can use `{<column>}` in value and VariaNFT will replace the text with data from the CSV file. Check out [metadata guide](/docs/metadata-guide) for details.
