# Unable to Get the Image

Once you see the alert "Unable to Get the Image" and the image in preview doesn't show up, here are the reasons and methods fix it.

## Check if the images can be opened
There are chances where the server hosting your images may be down for a while. Copy the image url from `Mint` or the CSV file and open it with Private Mode to check, and wait until the server is recovered. If you can open it in Normal Mode but not in Private Mode, it means that your images are sensitive and we are unable to access them. In this case, download the images and upload them to another image hosting service.

## Check if images hosting allows CORS
If your image is hosted on other services that isn't considered as an image hosting service such as social media, blog, and online news website, *Cross Origin Resource Sharing* may not be allowed. Browsers are set to block the requests at default as malicious websites may use this feature to retrieve private data.
